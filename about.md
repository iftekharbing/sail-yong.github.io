### About us
We are a group of mechanical engineers taking a transdisciplinary approach to uncovering new physics and mechanics in soft materials and biological systems, with the goal of advancing material design and manufacturing for novel products and industries. Our research combines theoretical analysis, computational simulations, data-driven modeling, and experimental investigations to explore complex transport phenomena at material interfaces, establish process-structure-property relationships, and design new functional materials. We focus on applications in advanced manufacturing, health care, and environmental sustainability. We are also closely collaborating with many other groups to expand our ability to study soft matter.

### Research
Soft matter, from droplets to membranes, presents fascinating properties, behavior, and functionalities. In parallel, biological active materials, such as molecular motors and microorganisms, leverage ambient energy for various tasks, offering blueprints for innovative biomimetic designs. These systems hold potential not only for technological advancements like wearable electronics, energy generation/storage, and personalized therapeutics, but also for addressing global challenges like infectious diseases and pollution. Given the complexity of these materials, evident from their intricate structures and interfaces, and scale-dependent dynamics, there is a clear gap in current modeling tools. Our lab spearheads the development of predictive modeling tools and theories across length and time scales that accurately capture fluid dynamics and interfacial phenomena in multiphase and multicomponent systems. We also are interested in developing experimental capabilities to  validate model predictions. We aim to elucidate the process-structure-property relationship in soft and active materials, providing concrete guidance for experimental endeavors.<br>
Current research topics include but are not limited to 
- Membrane shape remodeling in biological processes and biomanufacturing
- Colloidal assembly and transport at fluid and biological interfaces
- Machine-learning and data-driven modeling of biological locomotion and active matter
- Electrospray deposition of multiphase polymeric droplets
